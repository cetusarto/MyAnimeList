# MyAnimeList Dataset Analysis using Spark with Scala #

This is a learning project for a Big Data with Scala Spark course. It's objective is to apply an EDA (Exploratory Data
Analysis) on a dataset of free choice in order to demonstrate domain of the aforementioned tools while detecting
outliers, cleaning the data and summarize the main characteristics of the data set. 

## 1. Dataset Description ##

The MyAnimeList Dataset consists in four different schemas related with each other:
This dataset contains:

* anime information for 13,379 animes
* user information for 1,123,284 myanimelist users
* 214,271 interactions between anime pairs (recommended and related animes)
* 5,048,994 interactions between user pairs (friendship)
* 223,812,614 interactions between users and animes


![title](img/unnamed.png)

The different tables are stored in individual csv files except the User_Anime, which is separated in 70 individual csv
files. The tables used in this analysis were:

1. User: Contains information from the user. The mainly used attributes used are:
    1. user_id: String of characters of the user's nickname.
    2. num_days: Float of the number of days spent watching anime, useful to express a user's experience.
2. Anime: Contains information from the anime show itself. The mainly used attributes used are:
    1. anime_id: Integer of characters of the anime's id.
    2. start_date and end_date: Both timestamps of start and end date of the anime (The timestamp type is not really
       used as it only stores their date)
    3. genres: Array of strings holding their multiple genres
3. User_Anime: Contains information from the interactions between a user and an anime. Users can interact with an anime
   without giving a score. Users who give a score can do it without giving a review. The mainly used attributes used
   are:
    1. user_id and anime_id: Identifies their respective user an anime with the type above.
    2. favorite: Value of 1 if the user sets that anime as their favorite, 0 if not.
    3. score: Value from 1 to 10 rating the anime.
    4. review_id: If not null, it shows a review was made.
    5. review scores (review_score, review_story_score, review_enjoyment_score, etc..): Rates different aspects from the
       anime from 1 to 10. A user has to rate them all if he chooses to leave a review.
    6. status: Has the user "completed", "watching", "plantowatch", "dropped", "on_hold" the anime.

The dataset schema shows a very poorly normalized schema. Many of the attributes used in their tables were redundant,
for example, in the Anime table there is an attribute for each possible score (1 to 10), counting the total users who
have scored that number.
Another example is how in the User table there are counts of the different anime status which they have interacted with.
The is also how there is not a separate table for reviews only, as they are less than 0.1% of all interactions (as it
will be seen later), and almost all values posses null in all their review scores as it is not mandatory to leave a
review or a score.
Some normalization of the schema might improve their storage and ease up some problems.


The main focus of this study is the interactions between users and animes focusing in the ways they choose to rate the
animes and how the different attributes of both users and animes affect this rating.
The overview of the dataset can be found ond
the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/svanoo/myanimelist-dataset). This project uses version 2 of the
dataset.
It is also worth noting that this project is meant to run locally.

## 2. SparkSession configuration ##

The next snippet shows the configuration used for the SparkSession.
The only changed configuration is the reduction of shuffle partitions as there are not enough executors available (local
cores) to take advantage of parallelization.

```scala
  val spark = SparkSession.builder()
  .appName("App Name")
  .config("spark.master", "local")
  .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "5")
  .getOrCreate()
```

## 3. Main Questions ##

The project focuses in the solution of the following 8 questions which where proposed after analysing the data in the
latter parts of this documentation and the analysis of the different schemas.

1. What scores and reviews do users leave according their watch time?
2. What users get the most useful reviews according their anime watch time?
3. What scores and reviews do the different genres have?
4. What are the most/least reviewed genres?
5. What are the genres with most favorites?
6. What scores and reviews do users leave according the anime's age?
7. Why users decide to leave reviews?
8. How are all the kinds of reviews correlated?

## 4. Project Structure ##

In order to establish an execution order, this project structure is made. It consists on the coding stages that took
place in order to solve the main questions.

### 4.1 Helper Package ###

To avoid boilerplate the Helper package is built. It offers a series of methods for every notebook to use in the
repetitive tasks like the SparkSession builder and the reading of files.
There are two objects in this package:

1. Helper: Allows SparkSession creation and reading of files.
2. SchemaHelper: Stores the desired Schema for faster reading of the data.

### 4.2 Data Preparation ###

This part contains two notebooks:

1. Unifying Dataset: Takes the 70 raw csv files of user_anime schema and unifies them in a single parquet file for
   easier access in the next steps.
2. Cleansing Dataset: Drops useless columns from each file and saves them in a parquet file in order to optimize the
   reading process of each notebook.
3. Outliers Analysis: Analyses outliers from the main variables which are going to be used in the analysis checking 3
   Standard deviations and then 6 from the mean, and it checks the quantity of reviews from each group. It results in
   the following information by group:
    1. By anime: It presents outliers, which do not seem to cause big changes as they are not outliers at 6 SDs.
    2. By genre: It does not present outliers.
    3. By user: It still presents outliers after 6 SDs (a total of 2930), which represents nearly 0.3% of the total
       users.
    4. By user watch time: It does not present outliers afer 6 SDs
4. Data Integrity: Analyses the integrity of some data:
    1. Check reviews integrity: Checks if all interactions with reviews contain all the different types of sub-reviews.
       100% of all the reviews had all sub-reviews.
    2. Animes With no Scores: 395 anime have not been reviewed or scored.
    3. Null count: The 3 tables are analysed:
        1. User: No null values
        2. Anime: Some null values on start and end date (181 and 580).
        3. User Anime: Correct amount of null values (review_id null when there is no review, null score when there is
           no review, etc...)
        4. User Anime Date Check: All review_date values are correct (parseable and in a possible time frame)

### 4.3 General Analysis ###

This part analyses the most useful indicators of the data table which are later going to be used:

1. Anime:

- The majority of the animes have finished airing. Not much information can be extracted from this attribute

```
+----------------+-----+-----------------+
|          status|count|       percentage|
+----------------+-----+-----------------+
| Finished Airing|12755|95.33597428806338|
|Currently Airing|  258|1.928395246281486|
|   Not yet aired|  366|2.735630465655131|
+----------------+-----+-----------------+
```

- There are 44 different genres (top 7 on display)

```
+-------------+-----+
|        genre|count|
+-------------+-----+
|       Comedy| 5091|
|       Action| 3495|
|      Fantasy| 2785|
|    Adventure| 2379|
|        Drama| 2146|
|       Sci-Fi| 2087|
|      Romance| 1772|
+-------------+-----+
```

The most useful attributes from this tables are the genres and the dates of start and ending of the show's airing.

2. User

* A short summary of the most interesting columns is made and gives the following results:

```
+-------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|summary|        mean_score|     num_completed|      num_watching|          num_days|
+-------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|  count|           1123284|           1123284|           1123284|           1123284|
|   mean| 7.122094750748184|159.08479155761142|11.487242763183666| 55.73767017067854|
| stddev|2.4771154476423756| 228.7494619791284|35.294089253672325|134.43298319025172|
|    max|              10.0|             18659|             11014|          105338.6|
+-------+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

It shows big differences in the latter attributes, where the standard deviation confirms how dispersed the behavior of
the users is. The num_days attribute can be useful as it states how much anime can a user watch.

3. UserAnime

* With this notebook it is found that nearly half of the interactions do not have scores.

```
+---------+---------+------------------+
|has_score|    count|        percentage|
+---------+---------+------------------+
|    false| 94596066|42.265743788685654|
|     true|129216548| 57.73425621131435|
+---------+---------+------------------+
```

* For the 42% (interactions without score) it is shown that besides the application not letting users score without
  having
  watched the anime, a big group of users that have completed it, simply do not leave their score.

```
+-------------+--------+------------------+
|       status|   count|        percentage|
+-------------+--------+------------------+
|     watching| 4770335| 5.042847130661861|
|    completed|27334555|28.896080097030673|
|      dropped| 3023378| 3.196092742376834|
|      on_hold| 3010012|3.1819631907314205|
|plan_to_watch|56457786| 59.68301683919921|
+-------------+--------+------------------+
```

* While the other 58% contains mainly completed interactions.

```
+---------+---------+------------------+
|   status|    count|        percentage|
+---------+---------+------------------+
|completed|122194112| 94.56537408815471|
| watching|  2330148|1.8032891576704246|
|  dropped|  3217123|2.4897143978803706|
|  on_hold|  1475165|1.1416223562944896|
+---------+---------+------------------+
```

* We can also find the average and standard deviation of both the review_score and the score.

```
+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
|        avg_score|         std_score| avg_review_score| std_review_score|
+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
|7.491251933150234|1.7448017790109245|7.287402726275657|2.348781735684145|
+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
```

The previous results show that there are many interactions without a score which is the main attribute of this study,
this must be taken into account when reading the dataframe avoiding those interactions without them. However, this being
a central table, possesses great potential for analysis as it can be joined with other attributes and describe the way
this groups review.

With the previous analysis and the study of the dataset schema, the main questions are set and the Next Analysis is
made.

### 4.4 Next Analysis ###

Next Analysis contains notebooks where different tables are joined in order to answer the main questions.
Some notebooks follow a similar structure in order to get information from the data about how users review while being
grouped by different attributes.
Also, some notebooks write the resulting dataframe in a single csv file for easy visualization with PowerBI in order to
answer the questions.
The following explains the notebooks in the Next_Analysis folder:

1. Age and UserAnime: This notebook creates a new dataframe from the anime table with the year in which the anime was
   released and when it ended. This table is then joined with the main dataset, User_Anime, and grouped by the year. The
   main dataset is grouped by anime_id to ease up the following join:
   ![img.png](img/Age%20UserAnime.png)
2. Genres and UserAnime: This notebook creates a new dataframe exploding the "genres" array of the Anime table and then
   joins it with User_Anime to be grouped by individual genre and getting insights on them. As showed above, it is also
   grouped by anime_id performing the following join:
   ![img.png](img/Genre%20UserAnime.png)
3. UserAnime: This notebook does two main analysis. The first one, gets the correlation between the different types of
   review and shows it in a dataframe. The next one, tries to find what makes a user to give a review instead of just a
   score. To do this, the dataframe joins itself to compare how the users write reviews. The join is showed below:
   ![img.png](img/User%20User.png)

4. UserPercentile and UserAnime: This notebook assigns a percentile of the user spent time watching anime in order to
   group evenly and join them with the User_Anime dataframe and gather insights from it. The User Anime table is also
   grouped by user_id to facilitate the join:
   ![img.png](img/percentile%20UserAnime.png)

## 5 Question solving ##

The results are written in a csv file which is graphed in Power BI for readability

### 5.1 What scores and reviews do users leave according their watch time? ###

This question tries to answer how "veteran" anime users tend to rate the content.
In order to have a better distribution and easier analysis and, as mentioned above, grouping by percentile we get the
following results.

![img.png](img/Percentile.png)

Graphing helps to see how both the review_score and score average tend to go down with more watch-time. This can be due
to users being more critical of what they watch or just consuming
content with less quality.

### 5.2 What users get the most useful reviews according their anime watch time? ###

This question tries to answer what level of user "seniority" give the valuable reviews.
In order to get a more objective analysis, useful reviews is divided by the total reviews users have submitted and it is
shown in the following graph.

![img.png](img/PercentileUseful.png)

The graph clearly shows how much more useful are the reviews given by their "seniority", as it continuously increases.

### 5.3 What scores and reviews do the different genres have? ###

This question tries to find the best and worst reviewed and scored animes.
This first graph shows how Award Winning and Military animes have the best ratings with moderate to low standard
deviation.

![img.png](img/average_score%20by%20genre.png)

The second graph, shows an even higher rating for Award Winning animes and the lowest to Erotica ones.

![img.png](img/Average_review%20by%20genre.png)

Both of these graphs can be biased, as it was seen in the General Analysis, none of this genres were in the top count of
anime genres.

### 5.4 What are the most/least reviewed genres? ###

Based on the previous question we go further analysing how many reviews and scores are given by genre.
It clearly shows the strong superiority of interactions with the Comedy and Action genres

![img.png](img/reviews_given%20by%20genre.png)

![img.png](img/scores_given%20by%20genre.png)

Going back to the previous question it can also be seen how the reviews and scores of the top genres are sit in the
middle.
This positions this genres as the strongest and favorites of the users.

### 5.5 What are the genres with most favorites? ###

This questions tries to support the previous statement as we can se how they are the genres with most favorites voted on
all the platform.

![img.png](img/Favorites%20by%20genre.png)

### 5.6 What scores and reviews do users leave according the anime's age? ###

This question tries to answer if age has an effect on an anime's review and score.
The graph shows no particular preferences on the reviews but a clear preference on modern anime with the average score.

![img.png](img/Start%20Year.png)

The age of an Anime does not seem to effect on how it is reviewed but it does in how it es scored, showing tendency to
prefer modern content.

### 5.7 Why users decide to leave reviews? ###

This questions focuses on finding what can be the reason for users to want to leave a review, given that the main
interaction is just setting a score. To do this the average review_score and score are computed and then compared with
the average score when the user does not review.

```
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|   average_score |  AvgScoreWReview|AVG(average_score_WReview - average_score)|STD(average_score_WReview - average_score)|
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|7.476541122294622|7.320495958899991|                      -0.15604516339462182|                        1.6220288234143447|
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

There is no significant difference at plain significant difference,
but that small difference with the standard deviation shows
how the average score contains a slightly higher average and
than the one given in the reviews. Indicating that users tend to leave worse scores when
they're reviewing which could tell they prefer to rate worse when they are setting a review.

### 5.8 How are all the kinds of reviews correlated? ###

This question looks for the relationship between the different aspects of the anime that can be reviewed (story, sound,
characters).
In order to solve this, the UserAnime notebooks applies the correlation function between all the combinations giving the
following result:

```
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+
|             ReviewA|             ReviewB|       Correlation|
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+
|        review_score|               score| 0.936381896052212|
|  review_story_score|review_character_...|0.8621231722993825|

|        review_score|review_enjoyment_...|0.7715333384891444|
|        review_score|review_character_...|0.7542874702703505|

|  review_sound_score|review_enjoyment_...|0.7479334370477032|

|  review_story_score|  review_sound_score|0.7352997456092938|
|               score|review_character_...|0.7244926082815589|
|               score|  review_story_score|0.7233285726162524|
|review_animation_...|review_enjoyment_...|0.7206944477405531|
|review_animation_...|review_character_...|0.7156321430814482|
|  review_story_score|review_animation_...|0.7041150901101043|
|        review_score|  review_sound_score|0.5614722679788601|
|               score|  review_sound_score|0.5388575717897136|
|        review_score|review_animation_...|0.5273645551088207|
|               score|review_animation_...|0.5060986893915467|
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+
```

It is not surprising how all of them are directly correlated.
It's worth noting how the review and score have the stronger correlation but also how the story and character, and
animation and sound
are too, as it is that the score and review score posses the lowest correlation with both animation and sound. A
plausible conclusion could be how the animation and sound are tightly bounded and aisled from the
rest of rest of the aspects. Another one could be how the enjoyment of an anime relates strongly with the character and
story development.

## 6 Future implementations ##

The general analysis of this dataset can achieve interesting
conclusions, however this dataset offers much more value which could
lead to stronger user understanding, anime recommendations and ML training.
Each of the showed parameters could be more thoroughly grouped and getting more specific insights from each group. Some
of the genres could be cropped and just keep the important ones.
Many more things can be done with this resource and much more value can be found.

## 7 Conclusions ##

The analysis made just scraped the surface of what this dataset offers. Based on the information generated the following
conclusions could be stated:

* Users with more anime watch time tend to give lower reviews, it can be due to them being more critical of what they
  watch as they are more experienced or just lack of new and quality content lowering the average score.
* Users with more anime watch time give more useful and valuable reviews to the community.
* Action, Drama, Comedy and Shounen animes dominate the interactions and are the prefered genres of users.
* Users tend to value more new animes than old ones.
* Average score and review_score are not great measures to describe genre favoritism on the platform.
* Users tend to give slightly worse scores when they submit a review.
* Users enjoy animes more when they like the characters and stories.
* Users do not take strongly into account sound and animation in the general score.
